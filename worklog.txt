Things to do:


Day 1:

-Finish and organize HTML structure
     -Add a lobby
     -Ready button





Day 3:
     -Werewolf game should be irrelevant to clients
     -SERVER IS STORYTELLER
     -Server plays the werewolf game and communicates information between clients and the game, no need to send
     stuff from the game to the clients. all communication is held within server.js
     -Werewolf.js instead will send blurbs to the server of what turn it is, what needs to be prompted, etc.
     -Server.js DOES what werewolf decides (just as the storyteller follows the rulebook)
